# Pebble - v 1.0.1 #

Pebble is a customized version of the [Yeoman Generator gulp-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp). I created this repo as a starting point for static landing pages. Utilizing the Gulp Streaming Build system we can create well-crafted, modern landing pages quickly.
